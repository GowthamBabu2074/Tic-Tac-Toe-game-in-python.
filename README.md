# Tic-Tac-Toe-game-in-python.
Tic-tac-toe or X's and O's is a paper-and-pencil game for two players (X and O), who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

O | X | O
- - - - -
X | O | X
- - - - -
X | X | O

In the above example, O is the winner of the game

Now in this project, we will implement the same game using Pthon code.
